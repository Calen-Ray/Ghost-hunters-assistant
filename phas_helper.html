                                Poltergeists lower player sanity by throwing multiple items at once. The more items thrown, the higher the sanity reduction (items x 2). Occasionally, they throw items with EMF value 2-6. During hunts, they toss items every half second. During hunts, a Poltergeist throws items every half second.

                                    Yokai are reactive to voices, speaking nearby will spike their hunt sanity threshold to 80% and they become more likely to hunt and interact. However their other notable trait is their limited ability to track hidden players. They are less likely to pursue a player they regularly lose track of, or be lured by electronics unless the ghost was already nearby.
